My first -real- project made in rust. 

The inspiration to make this was to have a very lightweight program that provide some music when working. 
And hopefully someone other than myself might find this radio player useful too. 

I have never tried fltk-rs and rodio-rs before, which were the major crates used in this program. 
I stumbled upon some issues when trying to handle a audio stream, since most answers I found revolved around playing files locally. 
Luckily I found someone(JasonWei512) who had the answer, so I made the change that was mentioned - and want to share the repository to the person who pointed me in the right direction.
